Collect a substantial amount of patient data and relevant medical research.
Prepare the patient data by preprocessing and cleaning it, ensuring it contains necessary features and outcome variables.
Train a machine learning model using the patient data and medical research. Choose appropriate algorithms and techniques based on the type of data and desired predictions.
Customize the "suggestInterventions" function to analyze the predictions made by the model and suggest tailored interventions. Consider medical guidelines, historical data, and expert knowledge to provide meaningful recommendations.
Call the "adaptiveLearningAlgorithm" function with the patient data and medical research as parameters.
The algorithm will train the model using the provided data and research.
Predict outcomes for patients and suggest interventions based on the trained model and customized logic.
Execute the suggested interventions according to medical guidelines and historical data, considering any additional factors or approvals required.
